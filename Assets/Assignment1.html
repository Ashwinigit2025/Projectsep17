        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an <span style="color: lawngreen;">unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled</span> it to make a type specimen book. 
        ce<span style="color: aqua;">It has survived not only five </span>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was <span style="background-color: blue;">popularised</span> in the 1960s with the release 
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
        and <span style="color: lightseagreen;">more recently with desktop publishing software</span> 
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
